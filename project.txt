2 Overall Description
2.1 Product Perspective
The AI Coding Tutor is a standalone, web-based educational platform designed to integrate modern AI capabilities with traditional online judges. While it functions as an
independent system, it relies on external Large Language Models (LLMs) for hint generation and the Judge0 API for secure code execution. The system follows a client-server
architecture, where the frontend provides an interactive code editor (Monaco Editor)
and the backend manages the logic, database, and AI integrations.
2.2 Product Functions
• The system’s primary functions are divided into three core modules:
• Authentication & Role Management: Secure login and routing of users to
either the Student or Instructor dashboard based on their role.
• Instructor Tools: Automated generation of coding problems and test cases via
”Template Injection,” manual problem editing, and a progress analytics dashboard.
• Student Environment: An interactive IDE for solving problems, receiving Socratic AI hints (logic-based guidance), and obtaining code optimization feedback
(e.g., Time Complexity analysis).
• Code Intelligence: Real-time syntax checking, secure code execution in a sandbox, and AST-based similarity detection to identify plagiarism.
2.3 User Classes and Characteristics
• Students: Primarily novice to intermediate programmers. They require a userfriendly interface and guided feedback that encourages problem-solving without
giving away the final answer.
• Instructors: Educators who need tools to manage large classes. They are technically proficient and require efficient ways to create assignments and monitor
class-wide performance trends.
• System Administrators: Individuals responsible for maintaining the server,
managing database back
